UI Design
Galio website: https://galio.io/

## To do
1. Auto-zoom more when the map displays
2. ~When the user clicks the marker, display the restaurant information (possibly load new page?)~
3. ~Figure out how to implement database for displaying the menu in detail~
4. UX Design using Galio or other Frameworks
5. Get **right** information from database using id?
6. Ask users their dietary restrictions possibly another database along with user authentication?
7. Fun part :) new app name and icon
